I found out that SplittableRandom was a much faster Alternative to Random so that change shaved off a lot off time. 
Additionally I cut out as many calls as I could (using x * x instead of pow(x,2) for example).
I also realized I did not need to be iterating square since that will always be 4 billion.
My processor is a 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5
